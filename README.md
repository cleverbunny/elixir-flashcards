## What flashcards are good for

Flashcards are good revisioning tool. They are most effective when you already familiar with the subject.

#### Flashcards good at:

* highlighting knowledge gaps
* finding misconceptions or false believes
* helping to memorize
* learning new details about the subject
* sparkling discussions around the subject in groups of people
* bringing people together to play games

#### Not good at:

* explaining why something is working in particular way
* giving general overview and understanding of the subject

Combining books, documentation, tutorials, screencasts to get familiar with the subject and using flashcards to fill in knowledge gaps and master the subject is the killer combination.

## Learning techniques

Flashcards can help you master a subject. This is how they can be used to help you learn. Thank you to Jesse J. Anderson for great explanation in 1 picture:

On this picture:

* 2 cards answered correctly and fast
* 1 card answered correctly, but slow or hesitant.

**Next time** you practice you only need to go through cards from red(incorrect) and yellow(correct, but slow) pile.

The goal is to migrate all the cards into a green pile. 

![](learning_flow.png)

Cards from red pile move to yellow once answered correctly, cards from yellow pile can move into green or red or stay in yellow.

**Alternatevely** you can simplify this flow to only have red and green piles.

For the best result combine learning using flashcards with **spaced repetition** learning technique. With spaced repetition technique you would schedule your learning practices spaced in time. It could be a day, few days, week, month apart from each other. The longer gap is, longer you would remember what you've learned.

### Reward
